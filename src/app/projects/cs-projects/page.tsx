      description: "For our CS464 Deep Learning final project, my teammate and I developed an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system for Asante Twi, a Ghanaian language with very limited digital resources. Our objective was to build a model capable of converting spoken Twi into accurate text transcriptions, evaluated by Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER).",
