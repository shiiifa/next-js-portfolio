              I remember seeing students receive this award annually and never particularly thinking I would do something markedly spectacular in my capstone to be 2025's recipient. But as fate would have it, about a month after completing a public <SmartLink href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/obed-babington_day100-100dayschallenge-ashesi-activity-7319614240070250496-0VPJ?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAAC0KYZMBSFS8Iay7cDvZn7p4eDGn5yD5oFo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">100 days challenge</SmartLink> on my undergraduate thesis, "Hardware Accelerated Machine Learning with a Softcore Processor," I received an email from the Provost office that my work had been adjudged the best by my department.

              My capstone project focused on developing a fully on-chip hardware-software co-design framework using FPGA-based softcore processor and custom VHDL acceleration modules. The project achieved a 420× speedup over baseline execution, demonstrating significant innovation in embedded machine learning.
